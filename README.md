A simple app to track hours worked from Salesforce using Visualforce and Apex. Uses a custom object 'Hour Log' that looks up to users in the system. Each hour log has a field to enter hours Sunday-Saturday and associates them with the logged in user. Each User/week combination has a unique hour log record that users either edit or create when they enter their hours to avoid record duplication.
